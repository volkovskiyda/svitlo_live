[ІНСТРУКЦІЯ З НАЛАШТУВАННЯ СПОВІЩЕНЬ ЗМІНИ ГРАФІКУ](https://github.com/chaichuk/svitlo_live/blob/main/blueprint_manual.uk.md)

An integration for **Home Assistant** that displays the current electricity supply status for your region and queue, based on data from [svitlo.live](https://svitlo.live).

**New version (v2)**, which now mainly relies on the **API provided by svitlo.live** instead of HTML parsing.
The integration has been completely rebuilt — faster, more secure, and much lighter on the server.

## ⚙️ Main Features

- ✅ Displays the **current power status** (`On / Off`),  
- ✅ Detects the **next power-on** and **power-off** times,  
- ✅ Shows the time of the **last schedule update**,  
- ✅ Includes **built-in localization** (UA / EN),  
- ✅ Supports **all regions of Ukraine** and queue/group types (1.1–6.2, 1–6, 1–12),  
- ✅ Allows **multiple entries** (regions/queues) in a single Home Assistant instance,  
- ✅ All entries share **one common API request** to reduce network load,  
- ✅ Provides sensors and binary sensors ideal for automations and dashboards.

## 🔄 How It Works

### 🧩 Integration Architecture
The integration consists of two layers:

1. **`SvitloApiHub` (api_hub.py)**  
   A shared API hub for all entries.  
   - Makes **one HTTP request** to the proxy server (Cloudflare Worker) with the API key.  
   - Stores the response in a cache for 15 minutes.  
   - Prevents duplicate requests even when Home Assistant restarts.

2. **`SvitloCoordinator` (coordinator.py)**  
   A dedicated coordinator for each region/queue.  
   - Retrieves data from the shared hub (`api_hub`) without additional network requests.
   - Smart Proxy Selection: Automatically switches between the standard API (for most regions) and the specialized DTEK proxy (for Kyiv, Odesa, and Dnipro) to ensure maximum reliability.
   - Processes half-hour slots and builds power states (`on/off`).  
   - Schedules **precise entity state changes at the exact time of power switch** — without calling the API again.

### 🕒 Timezone Handling
- The API returns the schedule in **local Ukrainian time (Europe/Kyiv)**.  
- The integration converts this to UTC for Home Assistant,  
  ensuring all times are displayed correctly regardless of your HA timezone.

## 🔐 API Key Protection

The integration **does not expose the API key** anywhere.

Access to `https://svitlo.live/api/asistant.php` is handled via a secure **Cloudflare Worker** proxy that:
- stores the `x-api-key` privately in its environment,
- accepts keyless requests from Home Assistant,
- forwards the request to `svitlo.live` and returns the JSON response.

For DTEK Regions (Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipro):
The integration uses a dedicated, highly reliable data source proxy (dtek-api) that aggregates data directly from official DTEK websites, ensuring up-to-date schedules even when standard aggregators might lag.

This allows users to install the integration safely through HACS without exposing any private credentials.

## 🧠 Data Refresh Logic

- Home Assistant fetches new data **every 15 minutes**.
- The API response is **cached for 15 minutes** to minimize load.
- Between updates, the integration **auto-switches states** exactly at the scheduled times (half-hour marks).  
  For example: if power is scheduled to go off at 17:30, the “Electricity” sensor will change state **precisely at 17:30**, without any additional API calls.

## 🧩 Created Entities

| Type | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 🟢 **Binary Sensor** | `Electricity status` | True/False power indicator |
| 📘 **Sensor** | `Electricity` | Text status: “Grid ON / OFF” |
| ⏰ **Sensor** | `Next grid connection` | Next power-on time (if currently off) |
| ⚠️ **Sensor** | `Next outage` | Next power-off time (if currently on) |
| 🔄 **Sensor** | `Schedule updated` | Last successful API refresh |
| 📅 **Calendar** | `calendar.svitlo_<region>_<queue>` |  “💡 Electricity available” events (Kyiv local time) |
| ⏳ **Minutes to grid connection** | Shows the number of minutes left until the **next power restoration**. Updates every 30 seconds. Visible only when the power is **off**. |
| ⏱ **Minutes to outage** | Shows the number of minutes left until the **next power cut**. Updates every 30 seconds. Visible only when the power is **on**. |

## 🌍 Supported Regions

All regions of Ukraine (except temporarily unavailable ones, e.g., Kherson).  
For Chernivtsi and Donetsk — “Group N”; others — “Queue N.M”.

## 🧰 Installation via HACS

1. Open HACS → **Integrations → Custom repositories**.  
2. Add this repository:
   ```
   https://github.com/chaichuk/svitlo_live
   ```
   (type: *Integration*).  
3. Install `Svitlo.live` and restart Home Assistant.  
4. Go to `Settings → Devices & Services → + Add Integration → Svitlo.live`  
   and select your region and queue.

## ⚡ Usage Example

### Automation: Notify when power goes off
```yaml
alias: Alert before blackout
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.svitlo_kiivska_oblast_3_2_electricity_status
    to: 'off'
action:
  - service: notify.mobile_app
    data:
      title: "⚡ Power outage"
      message: "Electricity has been turned off in queue 3.2"
```
